This is just representation of how gravity works. this simulation made by javascript and canvas in html...
I commented out the shadow color and shadow blur in JS... shadow blur might give some sort of glow effect but it reduces the performance significantly...
also... i am simulating with 500 balls so the shadow blur reduces performance dangerously if you reduce the ball count you might see the output of shadow blur which creates the glow effect

the demonstration is linked below :
